excerpt: 'This research addresses the computational challenges of solving inverse kinematics for a 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) Pioneer 2 robotic manipulator. Traditional analytical methods become complex for redundant systems, prompting the exploration of machine learning (ML) techniques. The study employs Linear Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict joint angles from end-effector coordinates generated via forward kinematics. Performance evaluation using R-squared and RMSE metrics reveals KNN as the most effective algorithm, achieving 99.4% prediction accuracy with minimal error. Additionally, cubic spline interpolation ensures smooth trajectory planning, optimizing motion profiles for position, velocity, and jerk. This work demonstrates the viability of ML in simplifying inverse kinematics for industrial robots, offering fast and precise solutions.'
